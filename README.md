We have rebranded from **round3** to **bachmanfunded.xyz** due to loss of access to our previous domain. All future development and updates will continue under the new name and domain.

## Why the Change?

## üß† Personal Story: Why This Exists

I started building Round3 v2 three months ago. Here's the thing‚ÄîI have crippling ADHD, and honestly, I've never finished a good project in my life. Every time I start something, I get distracted, lose focus, or just... abandon it halfway through.

This project is different. This is my personal testimony.

I didn't know Go very well when I started this. I thought maybe I could use my ADHD to my advantage this time‚Äîhyperfocus on one thing until it's done. And somehow, it worked. 

Looking at this code now, it's not perfect. I'm using in-memory maps because I was learning. The email HTML is literally just the URL string. There's a function called `fuckit()` because I was frustrated with routing. But you know what? **It works.**

The whole authentication flow works. The invite system works. Writers can post updates, readers can subscribe. I built a complete API that handles JWTs, magic links, CORS, middleware‚Äîall while learning Go.

It feels incredible to see the whole thing functioning. For the first time, I built something complete.

## üõ†Ô∏è How Does the Backend Work?

Built from scratch with Go (while learning Go):
- **Magic link authentication:** No passwords, just secure email links with JWT tokens
- **Invite-only system:** Writers need invites to join, complete with email verification
- **Subscription model:** Readers can subscribe to writers they want to follow
- **RESTful API:** Clean endpoints that work with any frontend
- **In-memory storage:** Maps and slices for now‚Äîkeeping it simple while I learn
- **Email integration:** Using Resend for magic links and notifications
- **CORS ready:** Frontend can connect without issues

## üí° Why This Approach?

Building with **first principles thinking**:
- What's the fastest, simplest way for a founder to share their journey?
- How do we keep onboarding and authentication frictionless?
- How can readers support and interact with creators, not just consume content?

**Everything is designed for speed, simplicity, and real connection.**

## üßë‚Äçüíª Still Learning ‚Äî Feedback Welcome!

> I'm still learning Go and building in public!
> 
> Yeah, I know the email HTML is just the URL string. I know I should probably use a database instead of maps. I know there's a function called `fuckit()` in my router (I was frustrated that day).
> 
> But this whole thing **works**. The authentication is secure, the API is clean, and I learned a ton building it.
> 
> If you spot ways to make it better or more "industry standard," please open an issue or PR. I'd love to learn from you.
> 
> This might be my first finished project, but I want it to be good.

## üéØ What's Next?

- ‚úÖ Backend API (Done!)
- üîÑ Frontend with React (In progress)
- üìä Proper database (PostgreSQL probably)
- üí≥ Payment processing for subscriptions  
- üì± Mobile app maybe?
- üé® Better email templates (more than just URLs lol)

The backend works and handles everything I need. Now I just need to keep the momentum going and connect it to a proper frontend.
