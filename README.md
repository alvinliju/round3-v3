Absolutely! Here’s a rewritten, engaging, and clear `README.md` for **Round3**, reflecting your mission, the product’s value, and the technical approach. This version is founder/creator/reader-focused, while still explaining how the backend works and how others can contribute or give feedback.

# 🚀 Round3

**A platform for founders who are too busy to write.**

## What is Round3?

Round3 is a new kind of platform where **founders and creators get paid for sharing honest, behind-the-scenes updates about what they’re already doing**—and readers get a front-row seat to the journey.

### For Creators

- **Get paid for sharing updates** about your real work.
- **Get funded by your peers.**
- No extra writing, no pressure—just share what you’re building.
- **Invite-only:** To create an account, you need an invite.  
  (Send your friends [this link](#) to invite them!)

### For Readers

- **Support someone cool for just $5/month.**
- **Get real updates, ask questions, and access unique opportunities.**
- Know a founder who should be here? [Invite them!](#)

## 🛠️ How Does the Backend Work?

We built Round3 from first principles:
- **No passwords:** Magic links sent to your email for login (secure, simple, founder-friendly).
- **JWT authentication:** Fast, stateless, and easy to use in any frontend.
- **Invite-only:** Only invited creators can join and post.
- **RESTful API:** Easy to connect with any web or mobile client.
- **MVP-first:** In-memory storage for now—easy to swap for a database as we grow.

## 📋 API Endpoints

```
curl -X POST http://localhost:8080/login/request \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \

```

### 2. Verify Magic Link & Get JWT

```
curl -X POST http://localhost:8080/login/verify \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \

## 💡 Why This Approach?

I am building with **first principles thinking**:
- What’s the fastest, simplest way for a founder to share their journey?
- How do we keep onboarding and authentication frictionless?
- How can readers support and interact with creators, not just consume content?

**Everything is designed for speed, simplicity, and real connection.**
